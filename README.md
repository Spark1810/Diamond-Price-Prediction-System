# Diamond-Price-Prediction-System
Diamond price prediction is a complex task that depends on various factors such as market demand, supply, economic conditions, and consumer preferences. It's important to note that predicting the exact future price of diamonds is challenging and subject to uncertainties.
 
This repository contains code for a diamond price prediction system. The system uses machine learning algorithms to predict the prices of diamonds based on various features such as carat, cut, color, clarity, and dimensions. 

## Dataset Description

The dataset used for training and testing the model is a classic collection containing information about nearly 53,940 diamonds, including their prices and other attributes. The dataset consists of the following features:

- price: Price of the diamond in US dollars ($326--$18,823) - This is the target variable.
- carat: The physical weight of the diamond measured in metric carats (0.2--5.01).
- cut: Quality of the cut (Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal).
- color: Color of the diamond, ranging from J (worst) to D (best).
- clarity: Clarity of the diamond, ranging from I1 (worst) to IF (best).
- x: Length of the diamond in mm (0--10.74).
- y: Width of the diamond in mm (0--58.9).
- z: Depth of the diamond in mm (0--31.8).
- depth: Total depth percentage = z / mean(x, y) = 2 * z / (x + y) (43--79).
- table: Width of the top of the diamond relative to the widest point (43--95).

## Getting Started

To get started with the diamond price prediction system, follow the steps below:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the code files.
2. Install the required dependencies mentioned in the "Import Libraries" section of the code.
3. Download the diamond dataset in CSV format and save it as "diamonds.csv" in the same directory as the code files.
4. Open the code in your preferred Python development environment.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

The code includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset. The EDA covers the following steps:

1. Data cleaning: Removes any faulty data points, such as diamonds with dimensionless or 2-dimensional values.
2. Identifying and removing outliers: Filters out outliers in the dataset.
3. Encoding categorical variables: Converts categorical variables (cut, color, and clarity) into numerical labels using label encoding.
4. Null value treatment: Checks for any null values in the dataset (none found).

## Model Building and Evaluation

The code builds a machine learning model using XGBoost regressor to predict diamond prices. The model is trained on the cleaned and preprocessed dataset. The performance of the model is evaluated using various metrics, including R-squared, adjusted R-squared, mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), and root mean squared error (RMSE).

## Usage

To use the diamond price prediction system:

1. Ensure that you have followed the steps in the "Getting Started" section and have the dataset and dependencies in place.
2. Run the code in your Python environment. It will load the dataset, perform exploratory data analysis, build the XGBoost model, and evaluate its performance.
3. Once the model is trained, you can use it to predict the price of new diamonds by providing their features as input.

## Additional Notes

- The prediction of diamond prices is a complex task influenced by various factors. The model provides an estimate based on the given dataset but may not predict the exact future prices due to uncertainties in the market.

- The dataset used for training the model contains diamond prices from a specific time period. The model's accuracy and performance may vary for different time periods or datasets.

- For accurate and up-to-date market information on diamond prices, it is recommended to consult professional sources such as diamond industry experts, gemologists, or reputable diamond pricing platforms.

- It is important to note that the diamond price prediction system provided in this repository is a basic implementation for educational purposes. For real-world applications or more accurate predictions, you may need to consider more advanced models, incorporate additional features, or use larger and more diverse datasets.

- When using the code, make sure to validate and preprocess the dataset according to your specific requirements. Data cleaning, outlier detection, and feature encoding techniques may vary depending on the characteristics of your dataset.

- The code uses the XGBoost regressor as an example, but you can explore other regression algorithms and models based on your needs. You can experiment with different hyperparameters, feature engineering techniques, or ensemble models to potentially improve the performance of the prediction system.

- It is advisable to split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance and detect any overfitting issues. Cross-validation techniques can also be employed for more robust model evaluation.

- Documented steps and comments in the code will guide you through the process and help you understand the implementation details. Feel free to modify and adapt the code according to your specific requirements.

Remember that the diamond price prediction system is an estimation tool and may not provide precise results for every scenario. It is always recommended to consult with experts in the diamond industry for accurate pricing and valuation.
